# Django Authentication System with Decorators

## Overview

This Django project implements a **user authentication system** with the use of **decorators** to control access to different views based on the user's authentication status. It ensures that only logged-in users can access specific pages, and only unauthenticated users can access others, such as registration and login.

### Features:
- **User Registration**: Allows new users to create an account using Django's built-in `UserCreationForm`.
- **User Login**: Allows registered users to log in using Django's `AuthenticationForm`.
- **User Logout**: Allows users to log out and clear their session.
- **Access Control via Decorators**: Implements `@auth` and `@guest` decorators for controlling access to views.
  - **`@guest`**: Restricts access to pages like **register** and **login** to unauthenticated users only.
  - **`@auth`**: Restricts access to pages like **home** to authenticated users only.
- **Redirection**: Automatically redirects users to the appropriate pages based on their authentication status (e.g., redirects unauthenticated users to login, and logged-in users to home).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Django**

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tejatrivikram-007/Authentication_System_django.git
   cd Authentication_System_django
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. **Visit** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to see the project in action.

## Authentication Flow

- **User Registration**: 
   - Users can create an account via the **register page**. After registration, they are redirected to the **login page**.
   - **`UserCreationForm`** is used for creating users.

- **User Login**: 
   - Registered users can log in via the **login page**.
   - **`AuthenticationForm`** is used to authenticate users by verifying the username and password.

- **User Logout**: 
   - Logged-in users can log out, which will redirect them to the **login page**.

- **Access Control**: 
   - The **`@guest`** decorator ensures that only unauthenticated users can access the registration and login views.
   - The **`@auth`** decorator ensures that only authenticated users can access the homepage (`/home`).
   - If an authenticated user tries to access the login or register pages, they are automatically redirected to the home page.
   
## Decorators Used

This project uses two custom decorators to manage user access:

### `@guest` Decorator
Restricts access to views for authenticated users. If a user is logged in, they will be redirected to the home page.

Example:
```python
@guest
def register_view(request):
    # Only unauthenticated users can access this view
    pass
```

### `@auth` Decorator
Restricts access to views for unauthenticated users. If a user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.

Example:
```python
@auth
def home(request):
    # Only authenticated users can access this view
    pass
```

## URL Routing

- **`/register/`**: Displays the registration page.
- **`/login/`**: Displays the login page.
- **`/logout/`**: Logs the user out and redirects to the login page.
- **`/home/`**: Displays the home page for authenticated users.

## Code Overview

- **views.py**: Contains all the views for registration, login, logout, and home.
- **middlewares.py**: Contains the custom decorators `@auth` and `@guest` to enforce access control.
- **urls.py**: Maps URLs to their respective views.
- **templates/**: Contains the HTML templates for the registration, login, and home pages.

## Future Enhancements

- **Password Reset**: Add functionality to allow users to reset their password.
- **User Profile**: Allow users to create and update their profiles after logging in.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Implement role-based authentication to restrict access to views based on user roles (e.g., admin, user).
